# Stock-Market-Prediction
Investor always look for better return from the stock market by predicting through the gut feeling. Over the past few years many data Scientists try to develop models which can better predict the movement of the share market and hence maximizing the profits using various financial instruments. This project attempts to develop the supervised ML algorithms which can predict the share market movement more accurately than the base model.
To develop the model, the time series data of S&P 500 has been taken from the yahoo finance.
Methodology: Built supervised ML models on Decision Tree, SVM and Neural Net on Python for the given dataset.

Achievement: Developed the model with up to 29% increase (from 52.78 % to 68.25%)in accuracy against the base model
